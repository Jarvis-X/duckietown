This branch will store additional resource files (libraries, system images, etc...) which are not a part of the source code but may be necessary for the duckiebots.

V0.0 - First Duckiebot Image
V1.0 - Fixed issues with sklearn not working on the image. Image also comes with setup scripts pre-run and git repo already on image. This release also includes a real time kernel option that uses the RTPREEMPT kernel.
